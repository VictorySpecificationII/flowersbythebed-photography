# Flowersbythebed Photography Portfolio

Full-stack React portfolio site, production-deployed with CI/CD pipelines and AWS infrastructure automation via Terraform, featuring smooth SPA transitions and responsive design.

I built a portfolio site from first principles. I applied system design thinking to front-end architecture - routes, states, motion, and composition. Every decision, from media behavior to animation, reflects an engineerâ€™s process translated into design.\

With CI/CD and deployment via Github Pages, this is an exercise in end-to-end system design, from local React development to automated, versioned cloud deployment.
