          <h2>Photographer</h2>
          <p>
		I capture moments both digitally and on film, developing my own negatives and prints. From portraits and lifestyle to events and landscapes, I love experimenting with light, color, and composition to tell stories through my lens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, I found my inspiration came from traveling around the world seeing different kinds of people, places, and things. As you can tell from my photos, I love colors.
